    <title>CSE168 Final project - Alisha Lawson, Hallgeir Lien</title>

    <h1>CSE168 Final project (some fancy title?)</h1>
    <p>
        Our final project goal was to render a realistic image using the advanced rendering algorithms. We had two weeks to work on the project. We implemented global illumination through photon mapping, simulating caustics and indirect diffuse lighting. The objects in the scene show glossy and frensel reflections as well as phong highlights. To render the final image, we utilized antialiasing, depth of field, and tonemapping to achieve a realistic effect. For all images, click on them to show them in full size.

    <h2>Project idea and inspiration</h2>
    <p>
      Our inspiration was this photo that Hallgeir took of a flower after a rain shower. In particular, we wanted to capture some of the complex lighting in the raindrops like the caustics, highlights and shadows, as well as producing a good looking image.

    <h2>Technical details</h2>

    <h3>Modeling</h3>
    <p>
      The flower is modelled in 3ds Max, and consists of 248768 triangles in total. Each part (the stem, petals, center, leaf and raindrops) were stored separately for easier texturing. This is Alisha's first modelling project.

    <h3>Textures</h3>
    <p>
      All of the textures on the flower is procedurally generated. The leaf and stem have a faint cellular texture, with some added perlin noise on top. However, the environment map is loaded from a HDR texture and tone mapped.
    </p>

    <h3>Tone mapping</h3>
    <p>
        The HDR environment map and the final image is tone mapped separately. The environment map is tonemapped using gamma correction scaling, while the final image is tone mapped using the sigmoid function.
    </p>

    <h3>Depth of field</h3>
    <p>When a camera lens is quite close to an object, for instance when doing macro photography, you get a rather narrow depth of field. We wanted to have that effect in our image, and we believe we got it pretty right. We have an aperture radius R, focus distance F, eye coordinates  and camera coordinate basis u,v,w where w is the view direction. The depth of field effect is given by randomizing the origin of the eye rays, by generating a random position on a disc of a specified radius (our aperture size), and then translating the eye in the uv-plane by the two coordinates returned by the disc sample. We also had to adjust the ray direction so that it points in the direction of the point E+F*w.</p>

    <h3>Glossy reflections and refractions</h3>
    <p>
        We implemented glossy reflections by randomizing the direction of the outgoing ray. We sampled a hemisphere by choosing phi=acos(u1^(1/1+a)) and theta=u2*2pi, where "a" is the shininess of the material (same number as in the phong highlights). We then aligned the hemisphere with the reflective direction d_r = d - 2 * (N dot d) * N. The same process were done for refraction, just for the refractive direction instead.
    </p>

    <h3>Fresnel reflections</h3>
    <p>
        We implemented fresnel reflections, so that rays that hit a refractive object also send a reflective ray if the angle of incidence is large enough.
        It's implemented in two parts - first, we calculate the reflection coefficient Rs, using the fresnel equation for s-polarized rays. Then, when shooting out refractive rays we scale the results of these rays by (1-Rs), and also if Rs &gt; epsilon, send out a reflective ray whose result is scaled by Rs.
    </p>

    <h3>Lighting</h3>
    <p>
      For lighting of the scene, we implemented a circular directed area light which had the role as the sun. We could have used a point light very, very far away, but then generating the photon maps would take a very long time as most photons would miss the surfaces. A directed area light solves this by shooting all photons in the direction of the light's normal within a specified radius. We also modified the direct lighting code to take the radius of the light as well as the direction into account.
    </p>

    <h4>Photon map</h4>
    <p>
      We implemented photon mapping in our ray tracer for indirect lighting, including caustics. We used a caustics and a global photon map. We used the Photon_map class provided by professor Henrik Wann Jensen for storing and looking up the photons. The number of photons we used in the scene is fairly modest; 200 000 photons for caustics, and 200 000 photons for the global photon map, but we found this to be sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      When building the photon maps, we loop over each light, and for each light we sample an origin and direction. Finally we select the power to be the light source's wattage. We scale the photon power in the end after the light source has shot out all photons, because we don't know how many photons we have to send out in order to store the specified number of photons that we specify. We then call our tracePhoton() function which will trace the photons through the scene.
    </p>

    <p>
      In tracePhoton(), we trace a ray through the scene to determine the hit point, and then we choose randomly between storing the photon and sending out a diffuse photon, reflecting, refracting and absorbing (i.e. terminating) the photon. The diffuse color, specular reflectance and specular transmissivity determines the probabilities for each. If the photon is chosen to refract, another random number is generated in order to determine if the photon should be reflected due to fresnel reflection, or refracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a quick visualization of each photon in the scene. First is the global photons, and then the caustics.

    <h3>Raindrop effects</h3>
    <p>Due to the nature of the scene, we made a few assumptions to render the raindrops based off reference photos. In order to achieve a gradient shadow we observed in nature, we treat the shadow rays that start within a refractive object differently. We scale the the shadow intensity by the dot product of the hit normal of the shadow ray and the direction to the light. Althought this method is an approximation, we felt that it contributed an interesting effect. While we have soft shadows implemented in the code, the raindrop contact shadows appear sharp due to distance to the directional area light. As an additional subtle effect, we added phong highlights to the raindrops. </p>

    <h2>Division of work</h2>
    <p>
      We believe we divided the work amongst us quite evenly. However, the tasks were often interdependent so we both ended up being involved in planning and debugging.
